# Udacity_dog_app_capstone
The mission of this project is to classify dog based on their breeds, by analysing images of dogs. This will be carried out using Convolutional Neural Networks CNN and datasets provided by Udacity for the purpose of the project.

# Installation
The code should run without issues using Python 3.*. All the necessary libraries were imported using the Anaconda distribution.

# Project Motivation
This project was inspired by the need to perform image classification and also the need to try my hands out on Neural Networks

# File Descriptions
This repository consists of one .ipynb file and an html file. Both contain code used for the project.

# Results
I was able to get an accuracy score of 80.9% on my final model. This was an improvement on the initial model which gave an accuracy of 2.85% and 3.89% respectively. The algorithm was also able to correctly classify the images.
